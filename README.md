# Googgle Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QXmTrdXrN9acf7pC2ezk7p_W9lCqoyOZ?usp=sharing

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **student feedback survey data** to evaluate satisfaction levels across academic courses and programs. Using **Python and data visualization techniques**, raw survey responses are transformed into **actionable insights** that help identify strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas in academic delivery.

The analysis supports **data-driven decision-making** for enhancing student experience and academic quality.

## 🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains structured student feedback data, including:

* **20 survey questions** per course
* **Weighted rating scale (1–5)**
* **Average satisfaction scores and percentages**
* **Student participation details**
* **Graduation (UG) and Post-Graduation (PG) program information**

Each record represents aggregated feedback for a specific course and academic program.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data analysis and processing
* **pandas** – Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
* **matplotlib & seaborn** – Data visualization
* **TextBlob** – Sentiment analysis
* **WordCloud** – Text-based insight visualization
* **Google Colab** – Execution environment

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed

* Measured **overall student satisfaction levels**
* Performed **course-wise and program-wise (UG vs PG) comparisons**
* Identified **question-level weaknesses** impacting satisfaction
* Analyzed **student participation rates** across courses
* Classified satisfaction levels (High / Medium / Low)
* Generated **sentiment-based insights** using text feedback

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Identified **high-performing and low-performing courses**
* Compared satisfaction trends between **UG and PG programs**
* Highlighted survey questions requiring **academic or administrative improvement**
* Provided **data-backed recommendations** for enhancing teaching quality and student experience
